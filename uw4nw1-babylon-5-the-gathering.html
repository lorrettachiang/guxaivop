TLDR: I got bored, drew up a potential expansion with new civs, a new disease mechanic, new units, and poison gas. Okay okay, I know Gathering Storm was released only a little over a week ago. I know it might be the last expansion for Civ 6 given the fact they have never done more than two major expansions for a civ game. But what if they decide to do another one?

Babylon 5, set primarily between the years 2257 and 2262, depicts a future where Earth has a unifying Earth government and has gained the technology for faster-than-light travel. As we're so close to Gathering Storm's release and getting our second larger addition to Civ 6's world wonders, I thought it would be a nice idea to list up which Civs are represented with a World Wonder, which ones still need one (with proposals) and which popular Civilization Wonders still haven't appeared in Civ 6. At this point I just want to mention that it's sometimes difficult to assign a Wonder to one specific civilization, so I will assign Wonders to civilizations that actually build.

It's true that we should never think that, since we know Jesus, we’ll not experience anything bad. But it’s not true that the Church should prepare in order to survive the tribulation.
